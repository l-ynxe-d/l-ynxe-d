Hey, I'm Samrudh, a 16 year old high school student looking to: max out his coding stats in as many languages possible and learn more about AI & machine learning

I currently know how to code quite a bit in Python 3.11, having completed the course: HarvardX CS50P - CS50's Introduction to Programming with Python (edX certified course)
